# Apex Engine

This is a 2D game engine I created over the course of three months to test my C++ abilities and to have a base to use for future projects.

## Main Features:
- Basic lighting (color, size, and falloff control)
- Custom immediate mode graphical overlay
- Saved to/loaded from disk (using JSON):
  - Levels
  - Settings
  - Keybindings
- Sprite animation
- Simple dialogue system
- Sound effects / music
- 2D Physics (Box2D)
