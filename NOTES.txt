__ NOTES __

		-PAUSING-
- There are three (3) types of pausing
  1. Entire game loop pausing
      - This type of pausing is a debug feature used for inspecting animations/collisions/etc.
	    While active, the physics system is paused and the state manager's Tick() is not called. (sets 2 to true)
  2. Physics Pausing 
  3. In-level pausing
      - This type of pauing is a release feature which allows the player to pause the level
	    and access the pause screen (sets 2 to true)
  4. (?) Defocusing pause?

  
		-Map loading-
- Maps are loaded in using json files created by using the tiled editor
- Each map *must* have exactly one background, and foreground layer, and at least one midground layer.
- Midground layers are parsed when the map is created and items and tiles are converted to items/mobs
  
TODO:

	Move all Apex-prefixed classes to namespace apex instead?
	eg. ApexSpriteSheet -> apex::SpriteSheet
